This repo maintains the code used in my diploma thesis, conducted at the 
Control Systems Laboratory, Evangelos Papadopoulos Group (CSL-EP), at 
the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA):

Instructions
==
This is v6.1 of the BBMC software stack. In order to build and run this, the bbmc-starterware package is also needed as it provides the basic device drivers and firmware for executing bare-metal code on the BeagleBone.

Disclamer
==
This repo is not completed. This version is an alpha, and very unstable. 
Within the next two monthts between September-October 2014, the functionality 
found in the previous versions will be migrated into this newer, restructured 
version to produce a fully functioning servo controller.
